HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM BY REQUIREMENT 

Requirement 1 : Draw a simple cube
Cube is automatically rendered onto the scene nothing has to be done

Requirement 2 : Draw coordinate system axes
Axes are automatically rendered onto the scene nothing has to be done

Requirement 3 : Rotate the cube
'w' - rotates cube in negative x-direction (0.1 units)
's' - rotates cube in positive x-direction (0.1 units)
'a' - rotates cube in negative y-direction (0.1 units)
'd' - rotates cube in positive y-direction (0.1 units)
'q' - rotates cube in negative z-direction (0.1 units)
'e' - rotates cube in positive z-direction (0.1 units)

Requirement 4 : Different render modes (cube)
'f' - Face mode (Is in this mode by default on start up)
'v' - Vertex mode
'g' - Edge mode

Requirement 5 : Translate the camera
'ArrowUp' - translate camera in positive y-direction (by 1 unit)
'ArrowDown' - translate camera in negative y-direction (by 1 unit)
'ArrowRight' - translate camera in positive x-direction (by 1 unit)
'ArrowLeft' - translate camera in negative x-direction (by 1 unit)
'n' - translate camera in positive z-direction (by 1 unit)
'm' - translate camera in negative z-direction (by 1 unit)

Requirement 6 : Orbit the camera


Requirement 7 : Texture mapping
'f' - This is the same as 'Face Mode' from requirement 4

Requirement 8 : Load a mesh model from .obj
'b' - renders the bunny model onto the scene

Requirement 9 : Rotate the mesh, render it in different modes
IMPORTANT : To render the model/mesh in edge mode it must first be in default mode (face - 'b') i.e it must must be rendered onto the scene first in face mode
'l' - edge mode
'j' - vertex mode
'b' - face mode (default mode of the bunny model)
'w' - rotates model in negative x-direction (0.1 units)
's' - rotates model in positive x-direction (0.1 units)
'a' - rotates model in negative y-direction (0.1 units)
'd' - rotates model in positive y-direction (0.1 units)
'q' - rotates model in negative z-direction (0.1 units)
'e' - rotates model in positive z-direction (0.1 units)

Requirement 10 : Be creative â€“ do something cool!
